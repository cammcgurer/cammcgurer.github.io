        <h1>My About Me Page</h1>
        <h3>This page is all about me, Cameron McGurer, thanks for stopping by!</h3>
        <p>As I said my name is Cameron McGurer, and I'm a freshman at URI majoring in Computer Science.<br>
           I grew up in Connecticut and went to high school in East Lyme. During my time there I played soccer and ran track.<br>
           Over the summer my dad intoduced me to fishing. This was a perfect past-time (for this summer) because you could stay away from people and be on the water <br>
           Back home I have a dog named Miller and two cats. My dog is a black lab and hound mix who's probably the most photogenic dog on the planet.</p>
